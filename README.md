# Machine Learning algorithms in R

This repository contains machine learning algorithms, implemented in R for learning purposes, developed using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
 software. 

**Algorithms Implemented:**

[Linear regression](Linear_regression.R)

[Logistic regression](Logistic_regression.R)

[Qda and Lda](Qda_and_Lda.R)

[Naive bayers](naive_bayers.R)

[KNN and randon forest](KNN_and_randon_forest.R)
